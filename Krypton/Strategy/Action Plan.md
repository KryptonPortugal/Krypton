### Goal
Krypton believes that today there are many inefficiencies in the process of transferring knowledge, unjustified costs and, above all, a great lack of collaboration and dynamism in the dissemination and creation of written content.

### Solution
To achieve this objective, Krypton first intends to achieve stable national growth, for this we will resort to social networks to create traction on the platform for both creators and consumers.
Like any *Open-Source* project, Krypton gets stronger the more active intervention there is by the community, so Krypton intends to attract people with various skills, currently:

- Mathematical Content Creator - Persons responsible for disseminating practical or theoretical mathematical content.

- Auxiliary Content Creator - Persons responsible for producing multimedia content and programs that support mathematical content.

- Content Creator on Social Networks - People responsible for managing content on social networks

Each of these creative sections typically involves mathematics, but in very different ways.

All of these positions together create the [[Krypton ecosystem]], we believe this ecosystem will have a major impact on the future of knowledge transmission.


#### Current action

Krypton intends to develop mathematical content, auxiliary content to mathematics and content on social networks in parallel in the following areas:

- High school and below

- Higher Education at Bachelor's level

- Higher Education beyond BachelorÂ´s level


#### Future action

Krypton intends to expand to other areas of knowledge beyond mathematics, we will be open as a platform for community action to understand what the next areas of action will be, after all, the project belongs to everyone.
