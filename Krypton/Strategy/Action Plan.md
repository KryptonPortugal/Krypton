Krypton believes that today there are many inefficiencies in the process of transferring knowledge, unjustified costs and, above all, a great lack of collaboration and dynamism in the dissemination and creation of written content.

### Solution
To achieve this objective, Krypton first intends to achieve stable national growth, for this we will resort to social networks to create traction on the platform for both creators and consumers.
