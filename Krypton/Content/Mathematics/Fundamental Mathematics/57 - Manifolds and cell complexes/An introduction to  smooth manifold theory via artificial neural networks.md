# Introduction to manifolds

The reader should be aware that there will be an annoying amount of definitions at the beginning, however to do geometry we need to be conceptually equipped, after this the number of new concepts will eventually stabilise.

To talk about manifolds we have first to talk about what it means for a topological space $(X,\tau)$ to be **locally Euclidean**, we say that $(X,\tau)$ is **locally Euclidean** if there exists an integer $n \ne 0$ such that for every open neighbourhood $U \subseteq X$ we have that there exists an open neighbourhood $V\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ that is homoeomorphic to $U$, for short $U \cong V$.

### Definition : Topological Manifold

A n-topological manifold or only n-manifold for short is a topological space $(M,\tau)$ that has the following properties:
- $(M,\tau)$ is a Hausdorff space
- $(M,\tau)$ is locally Euclidean in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
- $(M,\tau)$ is second countable

This might not seem like very reasonable to have as a definition at first sight, however we will eventually that this are the characteristics that we are interested.

A good example that the reader should have in mind when thinking about manifolds is a sphere $S^n$ as seen in the image

![[Pasted image 20230628001214.png|300]]


Turns out that we are very much interested in objects like the sphere which are in the geometrical sense smooth, think of no "pointy" things or sharp corners, again think on the sphere, objects with the qualitative aspects of the sphere are called **smooth manifolds**.
Before formally defining a smooth manifold we need yet again to define three important concepts in geometry:

- Charts
- Transition Maps
- Atlas

### Definition : Chart
Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold.
A coordinate chart (or just a chart) on $M$ is a pair $(\hat{U}, \varphi)$, where $U = \varphi^{-1}(\hat{U}) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\hat{U} \subseteq M$ and $\varphi: U \rightarrow \hat{U}$ is a homeomorphism.

### Definition : Smooth transition maps
Let $M$ be a topological $n$-manifold.
If $(U, \varphi),(V, \psi)$ are two charts such that $U \cap V \neq \varnothing$, the composite map $\psi^{-1} \circ \varphi: \varphi(U \cap V) \rightarrow \psi(U \cap V)$ is called the transition map from $\varphi$ to $\psi$ .
We say that these maps are smooth are $C^{\infty}$ compatible if the transition map $\psi^{-1} \circ \varphi$ is smooth in the real analysis sense.

### Definition : Atlas
We define an atlas for $M$ to be a collection of charts whose domains cover $M$.
An atlas $\mathcal{A}$ is called a smooth atlas if any two charts in $\mathcal{A}$ are smoothly compatible with each other, i.e.  any two charts within that atlas are $C^{\infty}$ compatible.

After defining this concepts we note that a given manifold can have many different smooth atlas, think of how many ways you can cover the sphere with different atlas, with this it seems that $M$ has many different smooth structures associated with it which from a mathematical point of view are almost identical, to get over this we have that we will define a **maximal smooth structure** $[A]$ for a manifold $M$ as a the union of all smooth atlas of $M$ that are $C^{\infty}$ compatible with a given smooth atlas $A$ for $M$.

##### Remark:
There can be for a given manifold $M$ many different maximal smooth structures.


We are finally in conditions of defining what is a **smooth manifold**.




### Definition : Smooth manifolds
Let $M$ be a manifold and consider an atlas $\tau$ of $M$.
Define as $\tau_{1}$ the set of all neighbourhoods that cover $M$ which belong to $\tau$. 
We say that a manifold $(M,\tau_{1})$ is smooth if we have that $\tau$ is a **maximal smooth structure** in $M$.

##### Remark
We say that a differentiable manifold $M$ satisfies the regularization condition if for all coordinate functions: the Jacobian of the transition functions $\phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1}$ has a maximum rank.

From now onwards we will only consider **smooth manifolds** which have atlas of the type $A = \set{(\hat{U},\varphi):\hat{U} \in C}$ where $C$ is an open cover of $M$ .

## Tangent space

The tangent space $T_{p}M$ of a manifold $M$ at a point $p$ should be thought as the linear approximation of a given manifold $M$. 
Think of the sphere again you should think of the tangent space as the set of all vectors that live in the tangent plane, check the image below.

![[Pasted image 20230629173427.png|200]]


To put the concepts more formally, we consider a manifold $M$ which has has a local parametrization $\phi: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$, with $\mathcal{U} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ open set, then the vector tangent to the $k$ th coordinate curve
$$
h \rightarrow \phi\left(x_1, \ldots, x_k+h, \ldots, x_n\right)
$$
is given by (if you want a rigorous approach consider the reference )
$$
T_k(p)=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_k}(p), \quad p=\phi(x) . \tag{1}
$$
If the manifold satisfies the regularity condition that $\phi$ has a Jacobian matrix of maximum rank at $p$, then the tangent vectors $\left\{T_1(p), \ldots, T_n(p)\right\}$ are linearly independent and in particular form a basis form a basis for $T_{p}M$.

We call tangent bundle the set $TM$ defined as

$$
TM = \cup_{p \in M} T_{p}M
$$
this construction is from times to time useful to be formal.

Consider now a curve $c(t)$ in $M$ where $t \in [a,b]\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if we are interested in the tangent vector at each point $p \in M$ we have a local description of the vectors as (if you want a rigorous approach check for )
$$
\dot{c}(t)=\sum_{k=1}^n \dot{c}^k(t) T_k(c(t))
$$
This idea of tangent space naturally defines a tangent vector field, $X: M \rightarrow TM$, which a smooth assignment of a tangent vector $X_p \in T_p \mathcal{M}$, at each point $p \in \mathcal{M}$. 
In local coordinates this writes as $X_p=$ $\sum_{k=1}^n X^k(p) T_k(p)$. 

## Riemannian metric

We will talk about the concept of a metric in a manifold $M$.
When we are considering distances in a plane we usually use the Euclidean metric to measure the distance two points in a plane for example, however when it comes to measuring distance in manifolds it is not so easy, given that we have to account for curvature while measuring distance, it is no longer the length of a straight line between points that givens you the distance we need to account for curves which may curvatures in them as well.
To take this in consideration mathematicians came up with the concept of a metric 

$$
g = (g_{ij})_{i,j \in I} = \begin{pmatrix}
g_{11} & g_{12} & \cdots & g_{1n} \\
g_{21} & g_{22} & \cdots & g_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
g_{n1} & g_{n2} & \cdots & g_{nn}
\end{pmatrix}

$$

which is a matrix that enables to measure distances between two points in the following way. 
Firstly we need to consider a curve $c(t)$ in the manifold and we consider the length of the tangent vector as

$$
\|\dot{c}(t)\|_g=\left(\sum_{i, j=1}^n g_{i j}(c(t)) \dot{c}(t)^i \dot{c}(t)^j\right)^{1 / 2}=g(\dot{c}(t), \dot{c}(t))^{1 / 2}
$$

with this we can make measure the length of  $c(t)$ in $M$  in an interval $[a,b]\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ via

$$
L(c)=\int_a^b\|\dot{c}(t)\|_g d t
$$

with this way of measuring distances in manifolds we can introduce the concept of **Riemannian Distance** between points $A,B \in M$, which is given by 

$$
d(A, B)=\inf _c\{L(c) ; c:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathcal{M}, c(a)=A, c(b)=B\} .
$$

So the **distance between two points in a manifold $M$ is given by length of the shortest curve that unites the points.**
We call the pair $(M,g)$ a **Riemannian manifold**.

##### Remark
Note that the length of the tangent vector is dependent on the definition of the metric.




## Geodesics

Equipped with the notion distance between points we want to study the curves that describe the shortest path between points.
If the points are close enough, there is always a geodesic between them and this is unique. 
In local coordinates the geodesic $c(t)$ can be described by a system of nonlinear equations as

$$
\ddot{c}^k(t)+\sum_{i, j} \Gamma_{i j}^k \dot{c}^i(t) \dot{c}^j(t)=0, \quad 1 \leq k \leq n
$$

where $\Gamma_{i j}^k=\Gamma_{i j}^k(c(t))$ are the Christoffel symbols of second kind, they are given by the Levi-Civita formula
$$
\Gamma_{i j}^k=\frac{1}{2} g^{k r}\left(\frac{\partial g_{i r}}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial g_{j r}}{\partial x_i}-\frac{\partial g_{i j}}{\partial x_r}\right),
$$
where $\left(x_1, \ldots, x_n\right)$ represent the local coordinates on the manifold, we will talk more about Christoffel symbols next chapter Since they depend on the metric coefficients $g_{i j}$, the Christoffel symbols are intrinsic.

## Levi-Civita connection

Consider a Riemannian Manifold $(M,g)$, we call $\nabla: TM \times TM \rightarrow TM$ a linear connection if

- $\nabla_{f U} V=f \nabla_U V$,
-  $\nabla_U(V+W)=\nabla_U V+\nabla_U W$,
-  $\nabla_U(f V)=U(f) V+f \nabla_U V$

there may be many linear connections, but there is only one linear connection which has

- $\nabla g(U, V)=g(\nabla_W U, V)+g(U, \nabla_W V)$
- $\nabla_U V-\nabla_V U=[U, V]$

where $[U,V]$ is the commutator operator $[\cdot,\cdot]:TM \times TM \rightarrow TM$ that is defined as $[U, V]=U V-V U$, it can be proven that the commutator has the following local expression

$$[U, V]^i=U\left(V^i\right)-V\left(U^i\right)=\sum_{j=1}^n\left(e_j\left(V^i\right) U^j-e_j\left(U^i\right) V^j\right)$$
where the $e_j$ are basis vectors of a local tangent space of the given manifold.

In case we have such a connection $\nabla$ which has the properties from $(1)-(5)$ it can be proven that this connection exists and is unique we call such connection a **Levi-Civita connection** on $(M,g)$ .

To get a local expression for a general manifold of the Levi-Civita connection we use the definition of the Christopher symbols of the second kind given by $\nabla_i \mathrm{e}_j=\Gamma_{i j}^k \mathrm{e}_k$ and by using the following deduction we arrive at

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_X Y & =\nabla_{X^j \partial_j}\left(Y^k \partial_k\right) \\
& =X^j \nabla_j\left(Y^k \partial_k\right) \\
& =X^j\left(\partial_j\left(Y^k\right) \partial_k+Y^k \nabla_j \partial_k\right) \\
& =X^j\left(\partial_j\left(Y^k\right) \partial_k+Y^k \Gamma_{j k}^l \partial_l\right) \\
& =X^j\left(\partial_j\left(Y^l\right)+Y^k \Gamma_{j k}^l\right) \partial_l
\end{aligned}
$$


where we use the notation convention $\partial_{j}= e_j$ for the basis vectors of the tangent space.

##### Remark
We should think of the Levi-Civita $\nabla_{U} V$ connection as way to measure the variance of the vector field $V$ in the direction of the vector field $U$ which is itself another vector field.


## Submanifolds

To start this chapter we will need a lemma and a small definition.
We say that a subspace $W \subset V$ is non-degenerate if $g|_{W \times W}$ is non-degenerate.

With the previous definition clear we get from linear algebra that

The following are equivalent.
-  $W \subset V$ is non-degenerate.
-  $V=W \oplus W^{\perp}$.
-  $W^{\perp}$ is non-degenerate.

Let $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ be two manifolds, such that $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ is endowed with the induced topology and differentiability structure from $\mathcal{M}$. Then any Riemannian metric $g$ on $\mathcal{M}$ induces a Riemannian structure on $\mathcal{S}$ as
$$
h(U, V)=g_{\mid \mathcal{S}}(U, V),
$$

where $U, V$ are vector fields on $\mathcal{S}$ and $h=g_{\mid \mathcal{S}}$ is the restriction of $g$ on vector fields of $\mathcal{S}$,  we say that $(\mathcal{S}, h)$ becomes a Riemannian submanifold of $(\mathcal{M}, g)$.

We can with some reasoning decompose the tangent space of $M$ with only the tangent space of $S$ be seeing that $T_{p}S \subseteq T_{p}M$ is a non-degenerate space by definition of metric and so we have by the lemma above that '

$$
T_p M=T_p S \oplus\left(T_p M\right)^{\perp}
$$
where $\oplus$ defines the a direct sum of two vector spaces.

## Second fundamental form

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a submanifold of the Riemannian manifold $(\mathcal{M}, g)$ and denote by $\nabla$ the Levi-Civita connection on $(\mathcal{M}, g)$. 
Then for any two vector fields $U$ and $V$ on the submanifold $\mathcal{S}$ the vector field $\nabla_U V$ is not necessarily a vector field on $\mathcal{S}$. 
To put mathematically this concepts we say that $\left(\nabla_U V\right)_p$ follows the orthogonal decomposition:
$$
\left(\nabla_U V\right)_p=\left(\nabla_U V\right)_p^{\|}+\left(\nabla_U V\right)_p^{\perp}
$$
with $\left(\nabla_U V\right)_p^{\|} \in T_p \mathcal{S}$ and $\left(\nabla_U V\right)_p^{\perp} \in \left(T_p M\right)^{\perp}$ as we spotted in the last section.

We call the second fundamental of the submanifold $S$ is defined by 
$$L(U,V) = (\nabla_{U}V)^\perp$$ for any vector fields $U,V$ in $S$

It can be proven as a consequence of the Levi-Civita connection definition that 

If we let $U, V, W$ be arbitrary vector fields on $\mathcal{S}$, then the second fundamental form satisfies the following properties:
-  $L$ is symmetric, $L(U, V)=L(V, U)$;
-  $L$ is bilinear: $L(U+W, V)=L(U, V)+L(W, V)$;
-  $L\left(f_1 U, f_2 V\right)=f_1 f_2 L(U, V)$ for any two differentiable functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ on $\mathcal{S}$.



## Mean Curvature Vector field

Picture this: you have a submanifold, which we'll call $(\mathcal{S}, h)$, cosily tucked into a larger Riemannian manifold we'll denote as $(\mathcal{M}, g)$. The trick here is that our submanifold takes its metric directly from the "parent" manifold, $h=g_{\mid \mathcal{S}}$.

Now, I'm sure you're familiar with the second fundamental form, right? Well, in this case, we're giving it a symbol: $L$. We're going to be using it a lot, so best get comfy with it.

Here's the fun part: choose a point, any point! As long as it belongs to our submanifold $\mathcal{S}$, we're golden. For ease, let's say it's point $p$. Now, imagine the tangent space at this point, $T_p \mathcal{S}$. We're going to set up a vector basis there, with a crew of vectors $\left\{T_1, \ldots, T_m\right\}$ ready for action. 
Now, the term $L_{i j}=L\left(T_i, T_j\right)=(\nabla_{T_{i}}{T_{j}})^{\perp}$ you see? That's simply a normal vector to $\mathcal{S}$ - each of them is, for any $1 \leq i, j \leq m$.
That's because $L_{i j} \in \left(T_p M\right)^{\perp}$. 

Moving on, we have these $h_{i j}=h\left(T_i, T_j\right)$ guys - they're the coefficients of the Riemannian metric on our submanifold, and their inverse matrix has coefficients we'll conveniently label $h^{i j}$.

Now, this is where things get even more interesting. We're going to define the mean curvature vector at our chosen point. It's like a sort of "contract" involving our previous players, expressed like this:
$$
H_p=\sum_{i, j} h^{i j}(p) L_{i j}
$$
And guess what? It belongs to $\left(T_p M\right)^{\perp}$. More importantly, if you think about it as a mapping from point $p$ to $H_p$, it defines this awesome entity called the mean curvature vector field of $\mathcal{S}$, which has the cool property of being normal to $\mathcal{S}$ at every single point, note that $H_{p}$ is a vector field! 

Now, if you fancy a simpler life, you could choose to work with an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at $p$ call it $\set{E_1,\dots,E_n}$ instead of just any old basis.

This means that $h\left(E_i, E_j\right)=\delta_{i j}$, and you can express the mean curvature vector at point $p$ as:
$$
H_p=\sum_{i, j} \delta_{i j} L\left(E_i, E_j\right)=\sum_{i=1}^m L\left(E_i, E_i\right) .
$$
Remember, though, that the mean curvature vector field depends on the second fundamental form, making it an extrinsic notion. But hey, that's just the way the cookie crumbles in the amazing world of Riemannian manifolds!

You should probably be wondering why would we bother think about this previous constructions, well turns out that they are very important to study the notion of curvature which it is very complex in differential geometry and has many interesting angles where it can be tackled.

Let's dive into the magical world of manifold curvature, and get chummy with two types of extrinsic curvatures of submanifolds: the second fundamental form and the mean curvature. These two aren't just there to look pretty ‚Äì they're actually pretty good at telling us some really important stuff about the curvature of our submanifolds. 

Now, put on your adventure cap and think about a scenario where the second fundamental form is, well, nothing, zip, zero - $L_{i j}=0$. What does this mean for our submanifold $\mathcal{S}$? It actually gets a new title: totally geodesic. What's that? Well, think of a geodesic as a sort of "path of least resistance" on a surface. A geodesic on $\mathcal{S}$ is also a geodesic on the parent manifold $\mathcal{M}$. 

To really bring this home, imagine a flat plane chilling in a 3D space. Any straight line you draw on that plane is still a straight line in the larger space. That's what we're talking about when we say a geodesic in $\mathcal{S}$ is also a geodesic in $\mathcal{M}$. It just so happens that this agrees perfectly with our intuitive idea that a plane doesn't do any bending when it's in space. 

But wait, there's more! Now let's consider a situation where the mean curvature vector field is also a big fat zero - $H=0$. This earns our submanifold another new name: a minimal submanifold of $\mathcal{M}$. Picture $\mathcal{S}$ as a shy, humble little thing, occupying the least amount of space possible. If you were to poke and prod it, making it squirm locally, you'd find its volume increasing. 

These concepts - the second fundamental form and mean curvature - aren't just fun facts. They're actually super useful tools that will come in handy when we get to the topic of regularization.

## Relation to neural networks

The reader might have inquired what is the relation between the differential geometry concepts presented so far and neural networks. This section briefly discusses this relation, while the later sections will present a more detailed analysis.

The role of a given neural network is to approximate a certain target function $z$.
We assume that $z$ is an element of a target manifold, $\mathcal{M}$, such as the manifold of continuous functions on $[0,1]$. The output $y$ of the neural network is parametrized by $\theta=(w, b)$, the weighs and biases of the network. This way, the output $y$ belongs to an output manifold, $\mathcal{S}$, which is supposed to be a submanifold of the target manifold, $\mathcal{M}$.
The dimension of the submanifold $\mathcal{S}$ is equal to the number of network weights and biases, while the dimension of $\mathcal{M}$ in this case is infinite.

Lets see a very important example that illustrates the kind of manifolds that we are interested.

#### Example
The target manifold in this case can be chosen to be the space $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{C}[0,1]$.
Consider the logistic function as an activation function $\sigma$ and so in particular it satisfies the following differential equation 
$$\sigma' = \sigma(1-\sigma)$$
The manifold of outputs (know as the perceptron in AI)
$$
\mathcal{S}=\left\{\sigma\left(w^T \mathbf{x}+b\right) ; w \in \mathbb{R}^n, b \in \mathbb{R}\right\}
$$
is an $(n+1)$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathcal{M}$. At each point $y \in \mathcal{S}$ the tangent space $T_p \mathcal{S}$ is spanned by linear combinations of the functions which can deduced from $(1)$ where the parametrization is given by $\phi(w,b)=\sigma\left(w^T \mathbf{x}+b\right)$ and so we have as consequence the following tangent basis vectors
$$
\left\{y(1-y), y(1-y) x_1, \ldots, y(1-y) x_n\right\} .
$$
The submanifold $\mathcal{S}$ can be seen as an $(n+1)$-dimensional hypersurface inside the space of real-valued continuous functions $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{C}([0,1])$. 

In the case of one sigmoid neuron the target space $\mathcal{M}$ is not well approximated by $\mathcal{S}$ given the diversity of continuous functions that exist, to approximate better this function we need more neurons and consequently more parameters and a bigger dimension of $\mathcal{S}$.

Alrighty then, time to dive into the intricate world of neural networks. So, you know those little information-processing units we call neurons, right? Well, when you start piling them up in the network, you're not just making things busier. Each neuron you add nudges up the number of parameters, and this, in turn, boosts the dimensionality of our approximation manifold, which we'll call $\mathcal{S}$ for simplicity's sake.

So, what's the grand plan here? Imagine having a target in mind, say an element $f \in \mathcal{M}$ in the target space. Now, let's say you've also got a fixed $\epsilon>0$. The hope is that you'll be able to create a network that, with the right number of neurons (and thus high enough dimension), will shape $\mathcal{S}$ in such a way that $\operatorname{dist}(f, \mathcal{S})<\epsilon$.

And how do we measure this distance? Well, we use this fancy formula:
$$
\operatorname{dist}(f, \mathcal{S})=\inf _{s \in \mathcal{S}} \max _{x \in[0,1]}|f(x)-s(x)| .
$$

Pretty simple, right? But there's a catch. In an ideal world, you'd keep adding neurons until you achieve your desired approximation. However, the cruel reality is that neurons aren't unlimited, computational costs are very prevalent in this world.
This sets up a pretty interesting challenge: **how do you maximize the dimension of $\mathcal{S}$ while not being able to add an infinite number of neurons?**

Now, that's a tough nut to crack. But guess what? We're going to tackle this head-on in the next section. So, don't go anywhere ‚Äì the best is yet to come!

## The Parameter space
