### What we do?

Krypton is an *Open-Source* project that aims to create the [[Krypton ecosystem]] that allows the production and consumption of knowledge in an open format.
Currently, Krypton will seek to explore the behavior of the [[Krypton ecosystem]] in the area of mathematics.

### Where Do We Innovate?

The Krypton project intends to be the next method of production and consumption of knowledge where there is an open dissemination and collaboration between creators.

Krypton is innovative in two ways:
- In the method of collaboration between creators
- In the use of the potential of web languages for the production of teaching aid content.

### Vision

Krypton intends to implement the [[Krypton ecosystem]] in several areas of knowledge.

### Team

Since Krypton is an *Open-Source* project anyone can join the project.

Our team is divided into four parts:
- Content creators
- Content consumers
- Content reviewers
- Managers

##### Content Creators
Content creators are responsible for creating all content associated with the Krypton project in its various accesses.

##### Content Consumers
Content consumers are responsible for consuming all content in the project's various accesses as well as providing *feedback*.

##### Content reviewers
Content reviewers are responsible for actively reviewing the content of the platform in its various accesses.

##### Managers
The managers are responsible for ensuring that Krypton is functional and has an action plan for the future.

Within these roles there are internal and external to the project, given that the project is *open-source* the objective is that most people are **external**, however there will be a big minority of internal people to the project.

### Background and History

The **Krypton** project emerged at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in the year $2021$ from the discussion of two young people, who would become the two founders of the Krypton project of their name [[Tiago Ver√≠ssimo and Duarte Medeiros]], with the aim of promoting a more open sharing and consumption of knowledge.

This project emerged as an idea very different from the current one, after approximately $2$ years of idealization and iterations, a possible solution was sketched out.

Currently, the project is being passed from idea to paper and can be considered in a way that we are in the prototyping phase.

We are currently building the foundations of the [[Krypton ecosystem]] that allows for the production and consumption of open knowledge, in this case Krypton has chosen to start with mathematical knowledge.

The Krypton project is currently only interested in making itself known through social networks and building the structure of the future ecosystem, until then we will communicate through social networks.
