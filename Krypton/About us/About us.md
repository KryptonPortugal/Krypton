### Background and History

The **Krypton** project emerged at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in the year $2021$ from the discussion of two young people, who would become the two founders of the Krypton project of their name [[Tiago Ver√≠ssimo and Duarte Medeiros]], with the aim of promoting a more open sharing and consumption of knowledge.

This project emerged as an idea very different from the current one, after approximately $2$ years of idealization and iterations, a possible solution was sketched out.
