#### Quick intro
Hello, I'm Tiago and I am Portuguese, at the moment I'm a master's student in mathematics, outside of the master's degree I develop Krypton as well as study scientific and mathematical topics outside of my education.
I'm one of the people in charge of all fronts on Krypton.

#### Role in the project
My role in this project is to manage all fronts, from designing and implementing the project to managing administrative tasks and producing content on social networks.
Duarte helps me in some decision-making processes.

#### Background in the project
The entire philosophy/idea of this project is my own, since the day $0$ that I develop this project.

#### Personal Description
I'm a person, as a teacher of mine said with the "entrepreneurship bug" and extremely curious, from here it's all a consequence.

#### Why Krypton ?
Krypton intends to promote yet another way for knowledge to be disseminated openly, there are already many platforms where this fortunately happens, what Krypton does differently is to provide collaborative methods between content creators and consumers, as well as providing a different reading experience to the user.

#### What is the future of the project?
For me, the future of Krypton is this becoming a platform where people from a certain area of knowledge express themselves to an interested audience and at the same time this audience interacts with content creators.

#### Quick intro
Hello, I'm Duarte and I am Portuguese, currently I am a master's student and passionate about mathematics! I'm helping Tiago in the ideation, construction and development of Krypton.

#### Role in the project
My main role is to help Tiago with ideas for the Krypton project.
I help, mainly, in the debate of ideas and in the establishment of protocols.
Outside of administration, I intend to help with content development to help with project development.


#### Background in the project
The initial idea was Tiago's and he invited me to join the project.
In the various meetings we've had Krypton has done several things, I think we've now found a stable solution, but only the future will tell.


#### Personal Description
I think I have a different view than Tiago, perhaps a little more pessimistic, regarding everything related to the project.
I have a good work capacity that, combined with the right motivation, allows me to be productive for a long period of time.
I don't have business experience and I don't master the tools we are using, but I am willing to learn.
I have some programming knowledge, little or nothing relevant to the project, but I also have a very developed logical reasoning.


#### Why Krypton ?
I think the project differs from others by being *open-source*.
There are few tools that allow users to help create and upload files.
I think this aspect is important because while learning, a community of people with common interests is created. It is in creating bonds that we humans become complete.


#### What is the future of Krypton ?
The objective is to develop the structure and contents, without rushing so that they are of good quality so that Krypton becomes a *self-sustained* community, of people with an interest in knowledge and who, above all, enjoy learning.
