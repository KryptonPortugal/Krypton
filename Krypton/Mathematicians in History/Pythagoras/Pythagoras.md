# Short Story

Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician and philosopher who lived in southern Italy in the 6th century BCE.
He founded a group of followers called the Pythagoreans, who shared beliefs, dietary habits, and a code of behavior. 
The Pythagoreans are most commonly associated with the theorem that states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, there is evidence that this theorem was known in Mesopotamia before Pythagoras' time and that the earliest proof in a Greek context belongs to a later period.
The Pythagoreans were also interested in the numerical ratios of musical concords and harmony, connecting the sound produced by plucking a string at specific points with mathematical proportion. 
They believed that the orderly arrangement of heavenly bodies produced music. Pythagoras' **legacy is perhaps his insight that understanding mathematics can help one understand the structure of reality**.
