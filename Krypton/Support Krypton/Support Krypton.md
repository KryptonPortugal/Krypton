*Open-source* projects are not projects of two or three people, they are projects of a community of people with a common goal, which are managed by a private group of publicly known people, who have the immense responsibility of guaranteeing that the project works as a whole.

It is Krypton's philosophy to involve the community as much as possible, so we look for the community to help us in our decisions and directions for the platform, as such we look for the community to have an active role.

#### Transparency
Krypton in the **middle** of each month publishes the donation index on its social networks, which intends to be a number that reflects the balance of the platform in relation to its expenses for that month, as well as publishes **monthly** its plans for the month and the balance of the previous months, thus ensuring maximum transparency for all parties.

There are several ways to support the Krypton project:

### Donation:
You can get it through *PayPal* or even *Ethereum* (ETH).
Donating money allows project *managers* to allocate funds for expenses such as *hosting* fees, hardware, and other costs associated with maintaining the project.

#### Cryptocurrency
