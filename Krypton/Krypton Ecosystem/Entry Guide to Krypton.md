This page is intended to be an extensive tutorial on how to integrate the Krypton project into various functions.
In case of any question you can either send us an email or just join the discord, both are in the [[Contacts]].

**Remark:**
The master branch will be published to the website by the internal team of Krypton so that colaborators only need to care about the creation of contents in the GitHub repository.

### There are two ways you can contribute to Krypton 

#### Not using Github

If you do not want to bother about how to use GitHub and Obsidian and just want only to produce mathematical content, this is the best solution for you.

Via this method you can :
- Contribute with written mathematical document
- Contribute with social media content

##### How to do a mathematical contribution ?

###### Written mathematical content.
You should send us an email to kryptonportugal@gmail.com with the following data:

- Author name
- Section of the website you want to contribute
- Specify the document/page you want to put auxiliar mathematical content in
- The compiled auxililar content and if you wish the code that you used to produce that content, so that we can publish it in our website and GitHub !

That is it !

- Produce auxiliar mathematical content
- Influence the structure of the Krypton project with GitHub


#### Prerequisites

You will need $3$ pieces of software to contribute:

- Obsidian md editor (compulsory)
- GIT (compulsory)
- GitHub desktop (optional if you want a code free way) 

##### Obsdian md
To install Obsidian md editor you just need to follow the instructions in this website:
https://obsidian.md/

##### Git
To install Git editor you just need to follow the instructions in this website:
https://git-scm.com/

##### GitHub Desktop
TTo install GitHub Desktop editor you just need to follow the instructions in this website:
https://desktop.github.com/

###### Remark
Either using GIT with the console interface or github desktop you will need to create a GitHub accout to interact with the repository online

After having those prerequisites done you will have to clone our repository that is located in 
https://github.com/KryptonPortugal/Krypton
by following the next steps.

##### Using GIT
If you are using the console interface you already know your open-source stuff, Krypton is no different in this case.
Steps :
1. Just do a regular clone of the project into a folder in your computer
2. Using obsdian md, use the open folder as vault option in the place where exacly you saved the Krypton project, the Obsdian editor will recognise the .obsidian folder, which inside the repository, and configure the editor enviroment for you

Thats is it!

If you want to commit and push alterations that you do using the Obsidian editor, you just have to use is the usual GIT comands for it. (in the end you are just editing markdown files)

The final result of the enviroment should look something on this lines

**Step 1**
Open GitHub desktop and makre sure to make login in with your GitHub account so that you can interact with external content.

**Step 2**
Open the github website of the project https://github.com/KryptonPortugal/Krypton and click on the green code button and after that click on open with the GitHub Desktop, just like the image below

![[Step_1.png]]

The GitHub Desktop will ask you for the  path to store the repository make sure to remember the path you use it will be used in the next step.

**Step 3**
Open Obsdian md editor.
Select open folder as vault option, just like the image

and select the path that you used to store your GitHub repository as the folder to host your vault.
After that the Obsidian editor does all the enviroment configurations for you and it is ready to use.

That is it !

The final result should look something like this
