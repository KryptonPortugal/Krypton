This page aims to explain what the Krypton ecosystem is.

### What is Open-Source?

*Open-Source* refers to a type of software whose source code is publicly available, meaning that anyone can view, modify, and distribute the source code for any purpose. This contrasts with proprietary software, where the source code is typically private and only available to the company that owns it.
*Open-Source* software is usually developed by communities of volunteers, who work together to improve the software and share their changes with others. This collaborative approach can lead to rapid development and innovation such approaches have resulted in the creation of many widely used and highly regarded software projects.

### What is the Krypton ecosystem?

The Krypton project intends to implement an *Open-Source* philosophy in the transfer of knowledge using digital and human methods to achieve this.

The Krypton ecosystem can be put into a mathematical equation

$$\text{Krypton Ecosystem} = \text{Open Source} + \text{Social Networks} + \text{Knowledge} $$

We explain what each component means:

#### Knowledge

Krypton intends to solve the knowledge transfer problem, as such the first *input* that Krypton needs is what kind of knowledge it will deal with, be it mathematics or history the Krypton ecosystem only needs one type of knowledge.

#### Social networks

Social networks play an extremely important role in the Krypton ecosystem, given that Krypton is an *Open-Source* project, the community is extremely important, whether it be consumers or creators.

#### Open-Source

Krypton is an *Open-Source* project, as such it intends to use technologies that allow this practice, for that the solution involves using two softwares, **Obsidian md** and **GitHub**.
Krypton is written in **Obsidian md** and stored online on the **GitHub** platform where collaboration between consumers and creators is open, this is where content production is performed, through **GitHub** people they can both give feedback and create content, thus creating a collaborative environment accessible to all people who want to be part of it.

The above components when interacting in the real world form the Krypton ecosystem.
