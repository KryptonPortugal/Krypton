Let $(S_{1},R_{\alpha})$ be a dynamical systems 

Consider an orbit $\bar{\sigma_{x}} \subset S^{1}$ and the rotation map $R_{\alpha}: S_{1} \rightarrow S_{1}$

For the case $\alpha \in \mathbb{Q}$ we have that $\bar{\sigma_{x}}$ becomes periodic because you can always make gradual increments of $\alpha$ until you reach the intial point $x \in S^{1}$.

For the case where $\alpha \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ we will have to work a bit more.
Firstly, let´s consider $\bar{\sigma_{x}}$ that is a close set, therefore we have that $S^{1} \setminus \bar{\sigma_{x}}$ is an open set.

Let´s consider the maximal open interval in $U \subset S^{1} \setminus \bar{\sigma_{x}}$ .

Suppose $R_{\alpha}^{n}(U) \cap (U) \ne \emptyset$  for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

We can have two cases:

**Case 1**
Suppose that $R_{\alpha}^{n}(U) \cap (U) = U$ then $\alpha$ would not be irrational, which is a contradiction

**Case 2**
If  $R_{\alpha}^{n}(U) \cap (U) = A \ne U$ then we would get a contradication, because we would have that $A\cup U$ would be an open set, contradicting the open maximality of the open set $U$

Therefore $\bar{\sigma_{x}}$ is a dense trajectory.
