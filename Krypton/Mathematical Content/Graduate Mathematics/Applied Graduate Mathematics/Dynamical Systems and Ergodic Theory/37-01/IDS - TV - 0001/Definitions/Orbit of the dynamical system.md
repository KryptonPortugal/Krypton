Let $(X,T)$ be a [[Topological Dynamical System]]
We define the concept of an **orbit** of a point $x \in X$ as the set
$$
\sigma_{x} = \set{f^{n}(x): n \in \mathbb{Z}}
$$
in partcicular we can split this set into different sets being them the positive orbit $\sigma_{x}^{+}$ and the negative orbit $\sigma_{x}^{-}$ as the sets 
$$
\sigma_{x}^{+} = \set{f^{n}(x): n \geq 0} \qquad \sigma_{x}^{-}= \set{f^{n}(x): n < 0}
$$
