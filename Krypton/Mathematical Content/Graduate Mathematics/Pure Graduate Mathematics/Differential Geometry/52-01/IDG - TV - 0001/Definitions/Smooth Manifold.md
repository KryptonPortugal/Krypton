We say that two [[Atlas]] $A_{1},A_{2}$ are equivelant if  $A_{1} \cup A_{2}$ is a $C^{\infty}$ atlas and we write $A_{1} \sim A_{2}$ 
One can prove that the above relation is an **equivalence relation** and so we can define the quotient $A / \sim$  on the set of all **atlas** of the manifold we are working with.
The pair $(M,[A])$  where $[A]$ is the equivalence class of all $C^{\infty}$ [[Atlas]] is called a **smooth manifold**.
