Two [[Chart]] $(U_{1},\phi_{1})$ and $(U_{2},\phi_{2})$ of a manifold are $C^{k}$ **compatible** if the transition maps are a $C^{k}$  **diffeomophisms**, that is, if 
$$
\phi_{2} \circ \phi_{1}^{-1} : \phi_{1}(U_{1}\cap U_{2}) \rightarrow \phi_{2}(U_{1} \cap U_{2})
$$
is a **bijective** $C^{\infty}$ and has an inverse $\phi_{1} \circ \phi_{2}^{-1}$ that is $C^{k}$ as well.
