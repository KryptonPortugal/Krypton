### Why should I contribute to Krypton?

-   Contributing to an open source project that exposes mathematical content can help to make knowledge more widely accessible and reliable.
-   It can also be a great way to learn and improve your own mathematical skills.
-   Additionally, contributing to such a project can be a rewarding way to give back to the community and help the open spread of mathematics.

### What is the difference between people inside and outside the structure?
The Krypton project is supposed to be a place where people from the most varied backgrounds come to colaborate, therefore the main objective of the project is that 95 % of the people are outside of the structure, however there is that 5% that needs to make sure that all administrative and management decisions are taken for the sake of functionality of the project

The **very few** people that are inside the structure have a formal commitment to the project and have very specific roles within the organization and their position may or may not maybe monetized.

### How can I be an internal person to the project?

There are two ways to become internal to the project:

#### Recruitment
